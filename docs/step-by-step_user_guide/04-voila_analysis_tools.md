# Voila Analysis Tools

The data steward team will be adding a suite of interactive Voila notebooks (based on Jupyter and Python) to streamline your data management and analysis workflow. These user-friendly tools include:

- **Design of Experiments:** Plan and structure your experimental approach
- **File Uploader:** Simplify the measurement uploading process
- **JV Analysis Tool:** Examine current-voltage characteristics
- **Sample History:** Track the complete lifecycle of your samples

We are continuing to develop these tools and are open for feedback and ideas!
